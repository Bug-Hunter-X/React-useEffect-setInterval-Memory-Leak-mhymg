This repository demonstrates a common mistake in React applications involving the `useEffect` hook and `setInterval`. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code that leads to a memory leak. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version with a cleanup function to prevent the leak.  The issue arises from the failure to clear the interval when the component unmounts, resulting in an unnecessary increase in memory usage.
